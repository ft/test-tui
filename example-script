# To run this in Test::TUI's source tree, do this:
#
#  % perl -Iperl ./example-script

# This is an example script to demonstrate the usage of Test::TUI and some of
# its auxiliary modules. To do that, this script implements a test run through
# `aumix', a terminal-user-interface audio mixer.
#
# `aumix' works like this: It provides textual volume sliders that look like
# this:
#
#    ++++++++++++++++++O++++++
#
# The `O' represents the slider position, the pluses represent the length over
# which that slider may be pushed. To manipiulate the slider's position, you
# have several options:
#
#  a) Press a digit key, such as `5', which will move the slider to the 50%
#     mark. Similarly, `2' moves it to 20%.
#
#  b) Press `+' or `-' to move the slider right or left by exactly one
#     character-cell.
#
#  c) Press the Left or Right arrow keys, which works like `-' and `+'.
#
# There are more things you could do, but this is a nice set, that allows us to
# demonstrate quite a few of Test::TUIs features.
#
# This script tests the following:
#
#  - Does `5' move the slider to 50%?
#  - Move the slider around using +/-; see if the position changes correctly.
#  - Do the same for arrow keys instead of +/-.
#  - Tell the program to exit, by sending a `q' character to it.
#  - Check is the program actually exits and if the return code is 0 (success).

# This is a normal Perl script, so use strict.
