Test::TUI - Framework for testing full-screen terminal applications

REQUIREMENTS

    IO::Pty::Easy from CPAN
    Term::VT102 from CPAN

    pandoc <http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/> for building the documentation
    in `doc/'.


BUILDING THE DOCUMENTATION

    You may build documentation in man-page format, HTML and PDF. Manpages
    and HTML are fairly straight forward. PDF output requires a latex
    implementation such as pdflatex from texlive (pandoc generates latex
    sources and uses latex to generate PDF). The `all' target builds all
    formats. There are `man', `html' and `pdf' targets to build the other
    formats. The default target is `all'.

    % cd doc
    % make
    % make all
    % make man
    % make html
    % make man html
    % make pdf


USAGE

    See the reference manuals `Test::TUI(3)', `Test::TUI::Inspect(3)' and
    `Test::TUI::VT102(3)' after BUILDING THE DOCUMENTATION and the
    `example-script' file in the distribution's root directory.
